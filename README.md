# Gender-and-Age-Detection

The Gender and Age Detection project is a computer vision project that uses machine learning to predict the gender and approximate age of individuals based on their facial images. The project is implemented using deep learning techniques and leverages a dataset of facial images containing labeled gender and age information. It can be used for various applications, such as demographic analysis, targeted marketing, or personalized content recommendations.

The main components of this project include:

- Data Collection: Gathering a dataset of facial images with corresponding age and gender labels.
- Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the images to ensure they are suitable for training deep learning models.
- Model Building: Creating deep learning models for gender and age prediction.
- Training: Training the models on the prepared dataset.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance.
- Inference: Using the trained model to predict the gender and age of new facial images.
- Visualization: Visualizing the results and demographic distributions.
- The project can serve as a foundation for developing applications related to gender and age prediction from images.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset of facial images with gender and age labels.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `models/`: Saved model checkpoints.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model building, and inference.
- `results/`: Output visualizations and evaluation metrics.

## Data Collection
Data for this project can be collected from various sources or datasets containing facial images with gender and age labels. Ensure that the data is organized in a structured manner.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training, the images need to be preprocessed. This includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation if necessary. The `Gender_and_Age_Detection .ipynb` script contains code for this step.

## Model Building
Deep learning models are used for gender and age prediction. The architecture and training parameters are defined in the `Gender_and_Age_Detection .ipynb` script.

## Training
Training the model involves feeding the preprocessed data into the model and iteratively adjusting model weights. Use the `Gender_and_Age_Detection .ipynb` script for this purpose.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, loss, or mean squared error. The evaluation code can be found in `Gender_and_Age_Detection .ipynb`.

## Inference
After training, use the model to make predictions on new images. The inference code is available in `Gender_and_Age_Detection .ipynb`.

## Visualization
Visualize the results and demographic distributions using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Visualization code can be found in `Gender_and_Age_Detection .ipynb`.
